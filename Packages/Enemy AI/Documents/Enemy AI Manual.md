## EnemyAI

This script will make your enemy sprite look for and chase your player character. It uses a navmesh which will need to be added to the enemy component.

This script has notes in it which are simpple brief notes on what each function is.

The script is pretty self explanitory in terms of stick it on the enemy sprite and fill in the empty component serches with the player character.

At the end of the script is a gizmos. This isn't necessary abd can be deleted. All it shows is the enemys sight range.
